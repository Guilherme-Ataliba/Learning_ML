* **Population (N)** is the whole dataset you're interested (for example, all the people in the USA country)
* **Sample (n)** is a part of the entire population. It is important to ensure that the sample if representative of the entire population - avoiding what is called sampling bias. To do this, we study ways of sampling.

## ðŸ”· Representative Sampling 
A sample must be representative of the population - this means that the sample must have all the same characteristics as the population. For example, if the population is 50% women, the sample should also have 50% of women. 

**A representative sample** allows us to accurately represent the population by that sample - this is called *high external validity*

**Non-representative sample (biased sample)** doesn't represent the population very well - the characteristics of one are very different from the other.

## ðŸ”· Probability Sampling
These are sampling methods that assume that every member of the population has the same chance of being in your sample.

### ðŸ”¹ Random Sampling
It works by a process of **random selection** of the population to the sample. 
* Every one in the population has the same chance of being in the sample


### ðŸ”¹ Stratified Sampling
Works best when your population has a lot of **variation** - this way we can assure that the sample you reflect accurately the characteristics of the population. 

1. Stratified sampling works by dividing the population into subgroups - called strata. Each of the strata represents one characteristic of the population (that is considered important for the current study). 
2. Then you should apply a **random sample** in each stratum - this guarantees that the characteristics considered important are selected.
	* This also allows us to define the percentage of each stratum - meaning that you can sample 51% of women and 49% of men from a population
